# Worldwide Health Trends Analysis
An analysis of worldwide health trend from 1960 - 2015, and a modeling of continental classification.

The dataset comes from Kaggle and includes 345 health-related indicators from 1960 - 2015.
This report mainly includes data wrangling, visualization, and modeling. 
* Data wrangling: drop or fill null values, select interested indicators and years, etc. 
* Visualization: visualized the trend for indicators like GNI per capita, Population growth, immunization rate, 
and made correlation matrix for other indicators. plot world map for GNI per capita and immunization in an attempt to find the country and continental differences/similarities. 
* Modeling: use several ML models (e.g. random forest classifier, neural network, SVM) to classify continents based on 29 indicators. The accuracy for the best model is around 85%.
